PicturePacker
=============

Some websites have requirements when it comes to the size of images.
And it's boring to do the whole process via photoshop.
Therefore, this is a script that creates images of right size, 
according to an input file.

**Warning:** Tool is quick and dirty, requires the command **convert**
to work.
